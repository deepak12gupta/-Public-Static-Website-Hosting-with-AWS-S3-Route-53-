# -Public-Static-Website-Hosting-with-AWS-S3-Route-53



I'm excited to share my latest mini cloud project:
✅ A fully public static website hosted using AWS S3, Route 53, and a custom domain.

🔗 Live Now: project1.deepakgupta.info

🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
Amazon S3 for hosting HTML/CSS/JS as a static website

Route 53 for custom domain DNS configuration

GoDaddy as the domain registrar

Public-read bucket policy to allow access from anywhere

Index.html as the entry point page

🔍 What I Learned:
Setting up S3 static hosting

Updating DNS records to point to S3 bucket endpoint

Managing custom domain mapping via Route 53

Understanding bucket policy for public access

This is a foundational project for cloud engineers and a great first step in deploying websites without servers. More to come soon — with CloudFront CDN, SSL (HTTPS), and Lambda integrations!
